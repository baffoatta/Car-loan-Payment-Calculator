# Car Loan Payment Calculator

This is a simple Java program that calculates the monthly payment and total cost of a car loan, based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan duration provided by the user. This program also displays an amortization table that shows the breakdown of payments, including the interest paid, principal paid, and remaining balance for each month. I created this when learning Java. 

## Features
* Calculates the monthly payment total cost of the loan, based on the user's input.
* It also displays an amortization table that shows the breakdown of payments for each month.
* It again handles cases where the user enters a letter instead of a number, and provides an error message.
* Uses formatted strings to display the output in a user-friendly way.
